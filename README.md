BaicCode for reomte sensing and deep learning

#### A very concise implementation of semantic segmentation of buildings using U-Net

Just train.py and predict.py

* train_rsdl.py contains everything you need for training! Network definition, data reading, training setup...

* train_rsdl_v2.py adds a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate 

* predict_rsdl.py contains everything you need for inference! Network definition, data reading...

Results of 20 epoch and only 5 samples:
